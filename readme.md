## Customer Segmentation and Clustering

In this article we will explore clustering and customer segmentation using transaction data.

We will mainly focus on k-means clustering and determining the optimal number of groups, but we will also briefly look at the pam algorithm, dendrograms and the gap statistic.

Finally we will examine the created group composition using bar charts and word clouds.
