## Customer Segmentation and Clustering

In this article which can be viewed [here](https://markpratley.github.io/projects/Customer-Segmentation/), we explore clustering and customer segmentation using transaction data.

We focus mailnly on k-means clustering and determining the optimal number of groups, but we also briefly look at the pam algorithm, dendrograms and the gap statistic.

Finally we examine the created group composition using bar charts and word clouds.
